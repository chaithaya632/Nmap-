The purpose of this project was to perform a detailed scan of a local network to identify active hosts, open ports, and available services. This information can be useful for network administrators to understand their network landscape, detect potential security risks, and maintain better control over their infrastructure.

## What I Did

- Conducted a *TCP SYN scan* to quickly discover live hosts and open ports.
- Collected detailed information about running services and their versions.
- Attempted to detect the remote operating systems of the scanned hosts.
- Generated an HTML report summarizing the scan results for easy analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

- *Nmap* – Network mapper tool used for scanning.
- *Kali Linux* – Operating system used to run the scans.
- HTML – Report format for presenting the scan results.

## Why This Is Important

Network scanning is a fundamental part of cybersecurity and network management. By identifying open ports and services, administrators can:

- Detect unauthorized or vulnerable services.
- Improve network security by closing unnecessary ports.
- Monitor network changes over time.
- Prepare for deeper vulnerability assessments.

## How to Use This Repository

- The report provides detailed insights into hosts, ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Disclaimer

This scan was performed in a controlled environment on a network I own or have permission to scan. Unauthorized scanning of networks you do not own is illegal and unethical.
